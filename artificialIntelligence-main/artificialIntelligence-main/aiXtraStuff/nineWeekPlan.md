## 9-Week Plan: Applications of Artificial Intelligence

### **Week 1: AI Foundations & Decision Making**
- What is AI vs. traditional programming vs. ML
- Decision trees (visual/manual) - can use simple datasets like "should I wear a jacket?"
- Introduce AI in daily life (recommendation systems, smart assistants)
- **Project**: Build a simple decision tree in Python using if/elif/else
- **Standards**: 2.14.1 (intro), 2.14.5

### **Week 2: Introduction to Databases (SQLite)**
- Why databases matter for AI/ML (data is fuel)
- SQLite basics - creating tables, basic queries
- Python + sqlite3 library
- Data types and structure
- **Project**: Create a simple database, insert/query data
- **Standards**: 2.8.1-2.8.4, 8.3.1
- **Recommendation**: Go with SQLite - easier setup, portable, integrates perfectly with Python, no server needed

### **Week 3: Prompt Engineering & Modern AI**
- Introduction to Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Prompt writing techniques (clear, specific, context, examples)
- Iterative prompt refinement
- **Project**: Document prompt experiments, A/B testing different prompts
- **Standards**: 2.14.3, 1.2.1

### **Week 4: Evaluating AI Outputs**
- Hallucinations and AI limitations
- Bias in AI systems
- Fact-checking AI responses
- Validity, relevance, authenticity assessment
- **Project**: Analyze AI outputs for bias/errors, create evaluation rubric
- **Standards**: 2.14.4, 2.14.6

### **Week 5: Ethics, Society & AI Impact**
- Job displacement and creation
- Privacy concerns
- Algorithmic bias (real-world examples)
- Deepfakes and misinformation
- Intellectual property issues
- **Project**: Case study analysis or debate on AI ethical scenarios
- **Standards**: 2.14.2, 1.3.8, 1.3.9, 9.6.1

### **Week 6: Machine Learning Basics (Conceptual)**
- Supervised vs. unsupervised vs. reinforcement learning
- Training data, testing data, validation
- How neural networks differ from decision trees (conceptual, not mathematical)
- Overfitting/underfitting concepts
- **Project**: Use pre-trained models (like Teachable Machine by Google) to classify images
- **Standards**: 2.14.1, 5.1.1

### **Week 7: Hands-on ML with Python (Simple)**
- Install scikit-learn (easier than TensorFlow for beginners)
- Load a simple dataset (iris, or create one from SQLite database)
- Train a basic classifier (decision tree or K-nearest neighbors)
- Understand accuracy/evaluation
- **Project**: Build a simple classification model
- **Standards**: 2.14.1, 5.6.2-5.6.5

### **Week 8: Integrating AI with Databases**
- Using ML predictions with database data
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Storing model results back to database
- **Project**: Pull data from SQLite, make predictions, store results
- **Standards**: 2.8.8, 8.3.2, 8.5.4

### **Week 9: Final Project & Real-World Applications**
- Students choose a problem to solve with AI
- Options: Simple recommendation system, classification tool, chatbot with prompt engineering, data analysis project
- Present findings and reflections on AI capabilities/limitations
- **Standards**: 2.14.5, 2.14.6, 1.1.7, 1.2.2

## Key Points:

**For Databases**: **Definitely use SQLite**
- Free, no server setup
- Works seamlessly with Python
- Students can take database files home
- Perfect for learning SQL basics
- Easy to integrate with ML projects

**For ML/AI Tools**:
- **Weeks 1-5**: Focus on conceptual understanding and prompt engineering (no TensorFlow yet)
- **Week 6**: Teachable Machine or similar no-code tools
- **Week 7-8**: scikit-learn (much more beginner-friendly than TensorFlow)
- **Save TensorFlow** for an advanced course or later semester

**Pacing Notes**:
- Google's ML Crash Course is likely too math-heavy for intro students, but we might explore some of the videos and material they have to cherry-pick specific concepts (i.e., neural networks)
- Focus on understanding concepts and practical application
- Use visualization tools heavily
- Emphasize the evaluation and ethics components (often neglected but in your standards)
