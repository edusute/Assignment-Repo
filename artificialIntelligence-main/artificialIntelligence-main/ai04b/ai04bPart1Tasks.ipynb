    "**Aggregate Functions:**\n",
    "- `COUNT(*)` - counts rows\n",
    "- `SUM(column)` - adds up values\n",
    "- `AVG(column)` - calculates mean\n",
    "- `MAX(column)` - finds highest\n",
    "- `MIN(column)` - finds lowest\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:**\n",
    "- Aggregations work on MULTIPLE rows, return ONE result\n",
    "- Use `as column_name` to rename output columns\n",
    "- Combine with WHERE to aggregate filtered data\n",
    "- Great for feature engineering in ML!\n",

    "In **ai04b Part 2**, you'll learn:\n",
    "- **GROUP BY** - aggregate by categories\n",
    "- **HAVING** - filter aggregated results\n",
