    "**The Reality:**\n",
    "- Most ML data doesn't come from CSV files\n",
    "- Companies store millions/billions of records in databases\n",
    "- SQL lets you **filter data BEFORE loading** (saves memory!)\n",
    "- SQL lets you **combine multiple data sources**\n",
    "- SQL lets you **create new features** through aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Today's Dataset:** NBA basketball statistics (5 seasons of data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Learn:**\n",
    "- Connect to SQLite database\n",
    "- Write SELECT queries to extract data\n",
    "- Use WHERE to filter records\n",
    "- Use ORDER BY to sort results\n",
    "- Use LIMIT to control output size\n",
    "- Load SQL results into pandas for ML\n",
